# Search-Engine-Apollo

## Description
This project enhances an existing book search engine by transitioning from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API, utilizing Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this application allows users to search for books via the Google Books API, save their favorite books, and manage their selections through a user-friendly web interface.
